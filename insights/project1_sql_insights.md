1. Overall Revenue Performance

Business Question:
How much revenue does the business generate overall?

Insight:
Total revenue reflects the scale of operations and establishes a baseline for further performance analysis.

Business Implication:
This metric serves as a benchmark to evaluate future growth, seasonal trends, and the effectiveness of marketing initiatives.

Recommendation:
Track total revenue alongside growth rates to monitor business health over time.

2. Monthly Revenue Trend

Business Question:
How does revenue change month over month?

Insight:
Monthly revenue shows clear fluctuations, indicating periods of higher and lower customer demand.

Business Implication:
Revenue volatility may be driven by seasonality, promotions, or changes in customer behavior.

Recommendation:
Align marketing campaigns and inventory planning with high-performing months while addressing weak periods through targeted promotions.

3. Top Products by Revenue

Business Question:
Which products generate the most revenue?

Insight:
A small subset of products contributes disproportionately to total revenue.

Business Implication:
The business is heavily reliant on best-selling products, increasing operational and supply-chain risk if these items underperform.

Recommendation:
Ensure high availability of top products while improving visibility and bundling of mid-performing products.

4. Revenue by Country

Business Question:
Which regions drive the most revenue?

Insight:
Revenue is concentrated in a limited number of countries, with one or two markets dominating sales.

Business Implication:
Geographic concentration exposes the business to regional risks such as economic slowdowns or regulatory changes.

Recommendation:
Strengthen presence in high-performing regions while exploring growth opportunities in underpenetrated markets.

5. Average Order Value (AOV)

Business Question:
How much revenue does the business generate per order?

Insight:
The average order value indicates customer purchasing behavior and basket size.

Business Implication:
A relatively moderate AOV suggests opportunities to increase revenue without acquiring new customers.

Recommendation:
Implement bundling, cross-selling, and upselling strategies to increase AOV.

6. New vs Repeat Customer Revenue

Business Question:
Is revenue driven more by new or repeat customers?

Insight:
Repeat customers contribute a significant portion of total revenue, highlighting the importance of retention.

Business Implication:
Retention-driven revenue is more sustainable and cost-effective than acquisition-driven growth.

Recommendation:
Invest in loyalty programs and personalized offers to increase repeat purchase frequency.

7. Revenue Concentration (Pareto Analysis)

Business Question:
How evenly is revenue distributed across customers?

Insight:
Top customer segments account for a disproportionately large share of total revenue.

Business Implication:
High-value customers are critical to business success, but over-reliance increases revenue risk.

Recommendation:
Protect high-value customers while nurturing mid-tier customers to diversify revenue sources.

8. Revenue Growth (Month-over-Month)

Business Question:
Is the business growing consistently?

Insight:
Month-over-month growth highlights periods of acceleration and slowdown in revenue performance.

Business Implication:
Growth variability suggests sensitivity to external factors such as promotions, seasonality, or customer demand shifts.

Recommendation:
Use growth trends to plan proactive interventions during declining periods.

9. Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)

Business Question:
Which customers deliver the highest long-term value?

Insight:
A small group of customers generates exceptionally high lifetime revenue through repeat purchases.

Business Implication:
Losing high-CLV customers would have a significant negative revenue impact.

Recommendation:
Prioritize retention strategies for high-value customers through targeted engagement and rewards.

10. Churn Risk (Customer Inactivity)

Business Question:
Which customers are at risk of churn?

Insight:
Several customers have been inactive for more than six months, indicating potential churn.

Business Implication:
Inactive customers represent lost or at-risk revenue and reduced lifetime value.

Recommendation:
Launch re-engagement campaigns such as personalized discounts or reminders to recover dormant customers.
